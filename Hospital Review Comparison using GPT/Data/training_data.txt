When it became obvious that she was not going to make it they treated our family with such compassion.  They went above and beyond making sure we had everything we needed to make us as comfortable as possible so we could stay with her. Answering every question we had, making our mom comfortable so she was peaceful.  I can't begin to thank them enough for everything they did. All I can add is they made a horrible time alot easier. A huge thank you to everyone who took care of her and us‚ù§Ô∏è

This hospital is old, smelly and run-down. The rudeness/niceness level of staff was about 50/50. Like a lot of places in this area, the incompetence level of many of the staff was very lacking. We appreciate those that showed kindness and care to us, but unfortunately there were some who seemed bothered to help us. Doctor forgot to send all of the prescriptions home with us. Although the cafeteria staff was very nice, the food made me sick.

"They took my insurance card and driver's license at the ER, but didn't input it into system so they didn't get paid by my insurance. And guess who's now hounding me to get paid? The intake nurse didn't ""understand"" why I came in to the ER even though I explained that the CVS Minute Clinic wanted me to get a chest x-ray immediately because they thought I had pneumonia. They also refused to look at the notes from the CVS Minute Clinic. I will never go to this hospital ever again. They are completely incompetent."

"They took X-rays of my wife‚Äôs broken hip and SENT HER HOME. As in, her existing artificial hip had BROKEN OFF OF HER PELVIS. And they SENT HER HOME. A few days later, a real hospital in Birmingham did a hip replacement with bone grafts.  The excuse: we didn‚Äôt have a radiologist on hand to read the x-rays. It was the middle of a weekday. What kind of hospital doesn‚Äôt have a radiologist?!?! And besides that, Stevie Wonder could have looked at that x-ray and seen the massive break and the field of debris floating around, including 3 screws.  I would normally never wish anything this awful on anyone, but this crew has earned this sentiment: I hope every last one of them lives long enough to need extensive healthcare. And I hope they all receive the exact same level of ""care"" they provided to my wife. "

I had total hip replacement surgery at Jackson Hospital on February 7, 2022. I was in the same hospital gown the entire 3 day stay. Two of the RNs were really amazing, going above and beyond. The CNAs at no time offered to assist with personal care, at no time was I offered a wash basin. They were unavailable at best. I was not even given a toothbrush until day 3. I worked as a CNA for decades, I am not sure of exactly what the CNAs do except vitals at the beginning of shift and emptying trash at the end of shift. The social worker was extremely rude and unprofessional.

We are from out of town here on vacation, and had an episode that presented like a heart attack. Being that I have had an attack previously, it very scary.

Thank you so much for your care.

I went to the ER because of a broken tooth around 11pm. I was initially given strong pain pills & a prescription to pick up antibiotics the next day. Hours later my mouth was still throbbing so I returned &  asked to be administered an antibiotic instead of more pain pills ( I am a dental assistant myself and aware of how to treat the infection) The nurse however told me ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù when I asked about a penicillin shot to ease the pain and also said my pain only looked mild because I had no tears. She basically treated me like a drug addict and spoke with a snarky attitude. As a black woman it‚Äôs frustrating to be stereotyped and words can‚Äôt describe how much more horrible she made an already bad night. I appreciate the aides who were helpful but there are some nasty apples in that bunch.

Th rest of th ER staff was very caring also. But BaLinda walked me thru th procedure an assured me she had been thru th same an did th same plenty times before.

Daughter had surgery and we had a sweet nurse who was so kind and patient but after surgery they told us 1 parent could go back before they came to recovery room.. nurse from there was extremely rude and set on making a scene not explaining what was going on accused her father of trying to close a door on her threatening to call security. You dont treat someone who's small child has just gone through a traumatic experience, (she has terrible anxiety) that way absolutely no reason Other than that the other nurse was a sweetheart. Beware of the skinny rude blonde one

Clumsy me fell last night and tried to rest and hope the pain would stop, honestly I think my worry about my prior neck surgery and the fall messing it up had me worried more than anything! So I went to the ER at Jackson Hospital in Marianna.  I dread ER visits the very thought makes me feel even worseüôÑ...This was my first time going to this hospital and let me tell you this staff goes above and beyond their call of duty! So organized, efficient, dedicated and respectful to their patients needs and everyone was just as nice as could be! Thankyou all so much, if you knew the train wreck week I been having you would understand why your kindness meant so much to me. God Bless you allüòÄ!

I was with a group traveling down south for an exciting weekend and we had an overnight stop in Marianna. I have a medical condition that can be pretty cruddy sometimes tomdeal with and ended up in the emergency room at Jackson Hospital and I cannot say enough nice things about the staff at this hospital. They were thorough and were the kindest hospital staff I‚Äôve ever met. I don‚Äôt know if anyone from the staff on Saturday Feb 22nd will see this but thank you again for your help and kindness.

My fianc√© gave birth to my son here and the hospital stopped me from seeing my son due to their rule of only one and the same person as a visitor with no switching out at all. They have taken upon themselves to revoke my right as a father to see my child. They sent my fianc√© home while she was in labor and 3 hours later we were back because she gave birth to my child. Never would go to this hospital even if I was dying.

This hospital is just rough and unorganized, at first I come into the er entrance and the lady asks me if I have any cold or flu like symptoms, well I did so I told her the truth, so she takes my temperature & says to wait outside so she can let the people in the back know, even though I let her know I didn't come in for my cold, I came in for excessive bleeding, I was sitting outside for 10 minutes til another nurse asked me if I've been helped. The first lady didn't even sign me in, so now I got signed in, I finally get back to a room & wait for about 30 mins for another lady to come in and try to give me an envelope and said it was from financial aid to help with the bill. Which was odd to me considering, nobody has seen me to treat me yet, and secondly, all I've done in that moment was walk in the building & sign in, nobody even asked me for insurance info, just straight jumping to the bill before the doctor even sees me. I probably will avoid this place at all cost in the future, even if dying.

This is the absolute worst hospital I have ever been to in my entire life. I was attacked by a wild raccoon, after arriving to the ER and waiting for 1.5 hours I finally get seen by some Physicians Assistant who barely looks at my wound and laxidasically says ‚ÄúI doubt the raccoon has rabies, you should be fine, I‚Äôll have your discharge papers soon.‚Äù Luckily for me I killed the raccoon and took it to the health department who sent it off for testing. Low and behold the raccoon did have rabies, so if it hadn‚Äôt been for me taking action into my own hands and taking the raccoon to get sent off for testing I‚Äôd probably be dead by now!!! I hope this hospital gets shut down!

If you really care about your loved ones then I suggest driving alittle bit further down the road to Dothan or go to Tallahassee to get your medical care. I had a loved one go into the hospital on the 23 of last month with symptoms of pneumonia and they told her go to home and gave her an IV but other than that nothing. Knowing she had cancer they didn‚Äôt keep her over night for any further testing or anything then the next thing I know two days later she is on a ventilator fighting for her life. Unfortunately after all the work that was actually supposedly done we lost her that night. The doctor knew she has cancer and still didn‚Äôt do anything. If I could I would have this hospital shut down, they didn‚Äôt do anything and don‚Äôt do anything at all. Basically, since this is the only hospital in Marianna they do whatever they want and give you the treatment is subpar at best. Screw this hospital.
