Everyone from the emergency department to the inpatient nurses and Dr's were amazing.  They took such great care of my mother.  When it became obvious that she was not going to make it they treated our family with such compassion.  They went above and beyond making sure we had everything we needed to make us as comfortable as possible so we could stay with her. Answering every question we had, making our mom comfortable so she was peaceful.  I can't begin to thank them enough for everything they did. All I can add is they made a horrible time alot easier.
A huge thank you to everyone who took care of her and us‚ù§

This hospital is old, smelly and run-down. The rudeness/niceness level of staff was about 50/50. Like a lot of places in this area, the incompetence level of many of the staff was very lacking. We appreciate those that showed kindness and care to us, but unfortunately there were some who seemed bothered to help us. Doctor forgot to send all of the prescriptions home with us. Although the cafeteria staff was very nice, the food made me sick.

I was at Jackson hospital on Thursday  August 25 ,2022 with a family member! When we come to the hospital we always expect to be treated kindly.  By all employees. The treatment that she received by the registration lady was remarkable. She was kind,attentive,understanding, and showed compassion towards my aunt that was sick as well as other family members that was there as well . I did not get her name but she was a black girl with long dark purple hair .I‚Äôm only giving Jackson hospital one star because of the other registration lady that was sitting  in the back office . With us coming  in and out checking on my aunt she was rude and was discussing inappropriate things such as another worker smelling like marjuanna  and using offensive language. We were standing in the hall and heard her bad mouthing other patients as well . She was a white girl and appeared unhappy with her job by how she was behaving .we tried to get a name but could not but she was the only white girl sitting in the office that morning with brownish hair . It was another young black lady sitting in the office with her but you could tell  she didn‚Äôt seem to be interested in entertaining  her unprofessional behavior! This behavior and horrible attitude had me and my cousin surprised that Jackson hospital would have such an unprofessional employee in their hospital working ! She is not an good employee and really gives Jackson hospital a bad name ! She does not need to have any public contact !And the sad part is my family has had unprofessional encounters with her before and she still has her job ! The treatment from the triage nurse was not good either however my aunts nurse and the DR was amazing that day . I hope someone reads this and can past this review along so that the appropriate people can know what this bad apple in registration is doing as well as the beautiful kind lady that registered my aunt . The DR needs an reward for being amazing as well as the nurses in the ER . Not the triage nurse

I called the billing department to make automatic payments of $100 a month until my $499.31 bill was paid in full instead they charge me $100 a day to my credit card there were four charges by the time I noticed and it continued after I called, for a total of 8 days so $800 charged to my credit card over the course of 8 days. 9-26-2022 until 10-03-2022.  I called and put a request in for $700 to be refunded and to go back to what I had agreed-upon the $100 per month for four months with the fifth month being $99.31. The first time I called they said they would look into it and get back to me. No one got back to me.  The second time I called I had $700 total in charges with another hundred dollars pending for that day. The billing representative sounded helpful and sent the complaint and request with a high priority rating to be taken care of as soon as possible. I was told on October 4 I would be getting a call back on October 5th. No one called. The charges stopped after $800 but still no one called.  It is now October 10th And I have just gotten off the phone with the billing department again. They said they will refund only what was overcharged. $300.69.  They completely went against our payment arrangements they placed unauthorized charges on my card and no one had the decency to even call and tell me. The whole point of payment arrangements is to have payments that fit your budget.  They placed unauthorized charges on my card!!  I do not know how they could get away with such behavior in this town.  And to top it off it was the Covid antibody infusion and I was originally told by my dr that the infusion would be free of charge.  There were facilities in Tallahassee they were advertising doing the antibody infusion for free. I would‚Äôve gone there and gotten it if I had known that Jackson Hospital was going to be charging and it wouldn‚Äôt be covered.  Then they waited until August to send me a bill for the infusion that had taken place January 13th 2022.  I cannot believe that a hospital can get away with charging your credit card without authorization.
***Update**** only $200 has been refunded to my credit card so far.  I was told the entire amount that was OVERCHARGED would be refunded on the 10th of October but as of Today Oct 17th Only $200 has been returned to me. I will have to call them again today.

I really like the clinical staff that conducted my mammogram and ultrasound  they were very professional.
However the scheduling staff called me and canceled my original appointment and  reschedule me two weeks out from my appointment.  I then received a call after waiting additional two weeks to find out due to my primary physician being an ARPN they don‚Äôt have to honor her order.  So I waited two additional weeks to have the same test done that was originally scheduled because scheduling staff said they don‚Äôt have to honor the ARPN  order and they don‚Äôt know why they reschedule me because they should not have honored the order. My test did come out negative so had anything came back as cancer my treatment would of been prolonged two weeks because of the scheduling staff decision  not to honor my primary physician order. In closing I will be scheduling an appointment with my primary physician and I will be telling her how the scheduling staff at  view her ARPN position.

They took my insurance card and driver's license at the ER, but didn't input it into system so they didn't get paid by my insurance. And guess who's now hounding me to get paid? The intake nurse didn't "understand" why I came in to the ER even though I explained that the CVS Minute Clinic wanted me to get a chest x-ray immediately because they thought I had pneumonia. They also refused to look at the notes from the CVS Minute Clinic. I will never go to this hospital ever again. They are completely incompetent.

This is a revised review and belongs to Dr Arckmon, Dr Brown, Nurse Brian and sorry but I didn't catch the name of the LPN that works with this team nice young lady. My son has sickle cell and has not been getting treated well anywhere but thanks to this team  l believe they saved my son's life. He's been in and out the hospital for a month between here and chipley( the worst) and no one said they could do anything but treat him with powerful pain meds. This team did research and figured out the problem and now have a solution thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart. You all saved my son.üòç

I just love Jackson Hospital!!! I was treated there by ER doctor Molina and he was very nice and compassionate! I couldn't ask for better service. If I had to go to another ER I would go to Jackson Hospital again and again and again! They treated me like family that's how good they were! If you have not gone to Jackson Hospital I would tell you to go there and give them a chance. They are down home family people! Jackson Hospital keep up the great work!!!

They took X-rays of my wife‚Äôs broken hip and SENT HER HOME. As in, her existing artificial hip had BROKEN OFF OF HER PELVIS. And they SENT HER HOME. A few days later, a real hospital in Birmingham did a hip replacement with bone grafts.

The excuse: we didn‚Äôt have a radiologist on hand to read the x-rays. It was the middle of a weekday. What kind of hospital doesn‚Äôt have a radiologist?!?! And besides that, Stevie Wonder could have looked at that x-ray and seen the massive break and the field of debris floating around, including 3 screws.

I would normally never wish anything this awful on anyone, but this crew has earned this sentiment: I hope every last one of them lives long enough to need extensive healthcare. And I hope they all receive the exact same level of "care" they provided to my wife.

I had total hip replacement surgery at Jackson Hospital on February 7, 2022. I was in the same hospital gown the entire 3 day stay. Two of the RNs were really amazing, going above and beyond. The CNAs at no time offered to assist with personal care, at no time was I offered a wash basin. They were unavailable at best. I was not even given a toothbrush until day 3. I worked as a CNA for decades, I am not sure of exactly what the CNAs do except vitals at the beginning of shift and emptying trash at the end of shift.
The social worker was extremely rude and unprofessional.

This is by far the worst hospital with the most incompetent and uncaring staff. They don't do anything but sit around gossiping about patients. They underestimate your condition and dismiss your concerns.  The ER doctor rudely asked my husband why he was there this is the emergency room. When you recently had a stroke and you're expecting similar symptoms you go to the hospital. But they are lazy and don't want to do their job. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this hospital. Go to Chipley where they at least are professional and run all tests and scans and treat you for irregularities that come up instead of telling you to see your regular doctor when you need treatment then. A regular doctor requires appointments and referrals. The ER is when you can't wait for those things. Do your job or quit. If you don't have sympathy for patients then you're in the wrong field.

In 2018, my mom had a stroke a multiple TIAs. Jackson Hospital performed NO actual tests and didn't even ask whether or not she had prior history of stroke, they didn't ask about any risk factors. They MISDIAGNOSED her with a spinal issue that she very much didn't have. She went to two other hospitals and both confirmed her ACTUAL diagnosis. She spoke to a lawyer who confirmed that the practioner was guilty of "textbook medical malpractice" but cannot be sued due to Florida laws protecting independent contractors...

Furthermore, I myself was admitted to the ER at this hospital after a su!c!de attempt. The staff were incredibly rude and completely incompetent. The placed my call light COMPLETELY OUT OF REACH, I was drugged and confused wandering around the hospital and I was lost and the staff just stared at me and offered no assistance at all.

I have recently had to be seen not once but twice due to gallbladder pain. FINALLY after seeing Dr Anania and nurse Kenzie I was finally able to get answers. Not only did Dr Anania treat me she also explained why my pain was so unbearable. She also went out of her way to contact a surgeon for me and I am now scheduled for surgery this Thursday to have the gallbladder taken out and in my eyes that‚Äôs all thanks to Dr Anania going above and beyond when she didn‚Äôt have to. I will be personally thanking her and her nurse very soon for their care and concern. Thank you again lady‚Äôs. You are really special people and deserve a raise for sure.

I went to the ER because of a broken tooth around 11pm. I was initially given strong pain pills & a prescription to pick up antibiotics the next day. Hours later my mouth was still throbbing so I returned &  asked to be administered an antibiotic instead of more pain pills ( I am a dental assistant myself and aware of how to treat the infection)
The nurse however told me ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù when I asked about a penicillin shot to ease the pain and also said my pain only looked mild because I had no tears. She basically treated me like a drug addict and spoke with a snarky attitude. As a black woman it‚Äôs frustrating to be stereotyped and words can‚Äôt describe how much more horrible she made an already bad night. I appreciate the aides who were helpful but there are some nasty apples in that bunch.

I have never seen anyone at any hospital treated so disrespectfully as they treated my wife. The nurse LITERALLY yelled at her because she was crying in pain caused BY THE NURSE! My wife stated 2x that she was hurting her and the nurse didn't stop. And when my wife started crying, the nurse yelled "YOU ARE GOING TO SHUT UP AND YOUR GOING TO SHUT UP NOW". The name on the white board said Nurse Kenzie.

They were kind in checking in,  not a terrible wait an then th ER Nurse, BaLinda Taylor was phenomenal in her care and gr8 bed side manor.
Th rest of th ER staff was very caring also.
But BaLinda walked me thru th procedure an assured me she had been thru th same an did th same plenty times before.
I left feeling 100% better an she also gave gr8 daily preventive measures...
It's not that I don't want to see her ever again,,, just NOT in that capacity!!!

There's very few good nurses, arnps, or doctors that work at this hospital. I've lost two babies from this hospital telling me I was fine... Everyone who works there is pretty rude and they don't care about people they're just there for the money! I'm aspire to be an Rn one day ya know; I intend on treating people how I wanna be treated and treating everyone with the same respect! Oh and actually giving a flip about my patients!!! Thank you Jackson hospital for showing me how to not be in the medical field! üíï The only good ARNP there is Timira Cloud that I'm aware of.

My family have been using Jackson Hospital for years and have received excellent treatment at that hospital up until the evening of November 2, 2020. I took my son to the ER with abdominal pain. He had gastrc issues which was diagnosed by that same ER over the weekend. That evening, the  triage nurse  came out into the lobby and asked if my son  had COVID?  I   advised no he does not. "She asked in a condescending way well how do you know? I informed her I knew because he lived with me  and I was his mother so I knew he he had no exposure".  Also it is to be noted his temperature was taken before he entered the ER and his temperature was normal.  instead of taking him in a private location to question his symptoms, she questioned him in the lobby which is really a HIPPA violation. Triage nurse decided to pursue a power struggle with me.  She then decided he needed to be isolated because she suspected COVID.  She did not try to tak his word about his gastric issues or review his recent record. She just assumed. He was never tested for Covid for the time spent in the room. So where was the sense of urgency?   Meanwhile my son who was in extreme pain was moaning loudly because of   the intensity of the pain he was experincing. He reported  the doctor came in  yelling at him to be quiet or shut up from the pain. My son left the ER because of this. . Afterwards it was not a good scene. When we got home I contacted 911. A woman I assumed was the head emergency response  person  was more concerned about what happened at the  ER and focused little on his symptoms. She had an authortative way about herself and told my son that she wasn't going to tolerate him moving and scrimmaging in the ambulance.  Ignoring the fact that severe pain can cause
you to scrim, move, and moan. This  led me to believe that Jackson hospital  ER and  this female response worker had communicated with each  other,  so the attitude she presented led me to believe she  had  already formed judgement before reaching my home. When my son questioned her attitude after she made that comment, she decided he was being uncooperative and decided she wasn't going to transport him and walked out.  I had to transport him to the hospital in Chipley. They found his Potassium dangerously low,  he was dehydrated and utlimately he was admitted into the hospital for observation. No one should have to fight for treatment or be put on the defense in trying to obtain  treatment.  Chipley hospital staff demonstrated professionalism, and above all empathy for my son and treated him accordingly. Up until November 2, 2020 Jackson Hospital have displayed such professionalism. Reflecting back on the entire incident it was a humiliating experience. I am sure they have their side of the story, and it is documented  This review is my documented experience that   I hope to never repeat . As I am submitting this review my son is back in the hospital for the same gastric issues and I hope will be resolved soon. I understand protocols, policies and precautions should be followed for everyone's safety but those policies should be excuted with dignity and respect.

Daughter had surgery and we had a sweet nurse who was so kind and patient but after surgery they told us 1 parent could go back before they came to recovery room.. nurse from there was extremely rude and set on making a scene not explaining what was going on accused her father of trying to close a door on her threatening to call security. You dont treat someone who's small child has just gone through a traumatic experience, (she has terrible anxiety) that way absolutely no reason
Other than that the other nurse was a sweetheart.
Beware of the skinny rude blonde one

Jackson hospital was expedient, caring and thorough in the care of my wife and her recent injury.  Nurses Cody and Jeanne  were very caring, making sure she was as comfortable as possible while administering needed care.  Dr. Gonzalez ordered the X-Ray and provided the results to us minutes after entering ER.  He quickly ordered medication for pain relief and provided us with needed information to help in recovery.  Cody remained with my wife for 30 minutes monitoring her recovery.  I would not hesitate returning to the Jackson County ER, if needed.

So I went to the ER at Jackson Hospital in Marianna.  I dread ER visits the very thought makes me feel even worseüôÑ...This was my first time going to this hospital and let me tell you this staff goes above and beyond their call of duty! So organized, efficient, dedicated and respectful to their patients needs and everyone was just as nice as could be!

I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this hospital. I fell at BearPaw, a nearby canoe trail, and thought I broke my foot. The wait was brief, and the staff was caring and quick. My nurse not only brought a heated blanket for me because i was in my swimsuit, but also my friend who brought me. The x-ray came back within 10 minutes and everyone was so kind. I ended up with only a sprain (thank god) but i was so thankful for the urgent care, as i was two hours away from home. Thank you all at Jackson Hospital!!!

While I know every hospital does it's best this one just doesn't make the cut overall. I have only went here for two appointments that my doctors office sent me for and on both occasions I had the same problems. First they cant keep there billing right, then they billed insurance wrong, first time was wrong insurance, second was they didnt even bother billing my insurance.  Next they bill my insurance, need I remind you they make you pay while there, and come to find out my insurance covered the majority of the bill and they wont refund my money.  Next they have another bill they dont bill to my insurance at all and try to turn into collections and I hadn't even got my bill in the mail, which by the way was only 20 days after my doctorate visit!!! And on top of my overpayment on my first visit...what makes it worse is when I call, they cant even explain my charges or even assist with them...so how can you fix something if when you call them they are incapable of assisting over the phone.  Just sounds poorly managed and executed there, plan to go to other doctors and avoid this hospital for my needs. Also they have some of the highest charges I have ever seen, literally a 15 minute visit and tried invoicing me directly for more and when I questioned it they then tried invoicing my insurance...unethical!

I took my son to the ER this weekend. He had the flu and wasn't recovering well. They were thorough. He was given fluids and antibiotics. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and dehydration. My only complaint was the rudeness of Dr. Sheffield. She was argumentative straight off within the first couple seconds of being in the room with me. I expressed my concerns of dehydration and she argued. She never came back in the room to give me updates. The nurses just kept coming in to treat him without any explanation. I had to keep asking why certain things were being done. When they hooked antibiotics to the IV, I didn't know why. The nurse didn't either. Because I asked she checked his chart. The xray showed he had pnemonia and the doctor wanted him started on antibiotics. We also left with a prescription for antibiotics. I was thankful for thier thoroughness but frustrated with the lack of communication and poor bedside manner of Dr. Sheffield. She did come for a second before discharge but wasn't very nice and kind of prideful because he was dehydrated after she argued he wasn't. She seems to be a good doctor but her attitude needs work. I don't know if I would go back.

My fianc√© gave birth to my son here and the hospital stopped me from seeing my son due to their rule of only one and the same person as a visitor with no switching out at all. They have taken upon themselves to revoke my right as a father to see my child. They sent my fianc√© home while she was in labor and 3 hours later we were back because she gave birth to my child. Never would go to this hospital even if I was dying.

This hospital is just rough and unorganized, at first I come into the er entrance and the lady asks me if I have any cold or flu like symptoms, well I did so I told her the truth, so she takes my temperature & says to wait outside so she can let the people in the back know, even though I let her know I didn't come in for my cold, I came in for excessive bleeding, I was sitting outside for 10 minutes til another nurse asked me if I've been helped. The first lady didn't even sign me in, so now I got signed in, I finally get back to a room & wait for about 30 mins for another lady to come in and try to give me an envelope and said it was from financial aid to help with the bill. Which was odd to me considering, nobody has seen me to treat me yet, and secondly, all I've done in that moment was walk in the building & sign in, nobody even asked me for insurance info, just straight jumping to the bill before the doctor even sees me. I probably will avoid this place at all cost in the future, even if dying.

When there for help on August 23 around 7 AM. The lady who registered me and all my nurses and doctors were awesome. Yet the intake nurse was getting my vitals. I mentioned to her I had stared some antibiotics and she began to fuss at me. She began telling me that I should not take antibiotics unless prescribed (and they had been). She began to tell me that people like me shout be educated I not doing this because people like me is the reason we have incurable viruses in the world. Mind you I am sitting here in pain and just ready to feel better. She should be absolutely ashamed to talk to someone like that. She was supposed to be there to help me not scold me like I'm a child.. Very rude .. Just disgusted by her actions...Monica B

This is the absolute worst hospital I have ever been to in my entire life. I was attacked by a wild raccoon, after arriving to the ER and waiting for 1.5 hours I finally get seen by some Physicians Assistant who barely looks at my wound and laxidasically says ‚ÄúI doubt the raccoon has rabies, you should be fine, I‚Äôll have your discharge papers soon.‚Äù Luckily for me I killed the raccoon and took it to the health department who sent it off for testing. Low and behold the raccoon did have rabies, so if it hadn‚Äôt been for me taking action into my own hands and taking the raccoon to get sent off for testing I‚Äôd probably be dead by now!!! I hope this hospital gets shut down!

If you really care about your loved ones then I suggest driving alittle bit further down the road to Dothan or go to Tallahassee to get your medical care. I had a loved one go into the hospital on the 23 of last month with symptoms of pneumonia and they told her go to home and gave her an IV but other than that nothing. Knowing she had cancer they didn‚Äôt keep her over night for any further testing or anything then the next thing I know two days later she is on a ventilator fighting for her life. Unfortunately after all the work that was actually supposedly done we lost her that night. The doctor knew she has cancer and still didn‚Äôt do anything.
If I could I would have this hospital shut down, they didn‚Äôt do anything and don‚Äôt do anything at all.
Basically, since this is the only hospital in Marianna they do whatever they want and give you the treatment is subpar at best.
Screw this hospital.

I'm sure there are some good people that work here. But this place is a freaking joke. My wife had knee surgery 8 yrs ago and had to take her back tonight. 11-26-19. Knee was extremely swollen and she could barely walk. Oh it's fine and you should go home. Never again will we go back....

I had vocal cord surgery here on March 30, 2016, performed by Dr. Angelo Consiglio. Let me first tell you that I have had 2 previous surgeries, unrelated, that did not go so well, and left me frightened, of going under anesthesia. The entire procedure was TOP RATE, and I was taken care of, in such a manner, that any lingering fear, was unwarranted. The pre, and post op staff were fabulous. The anesthesiologist took all the pre op, and during op procedures, to ensure I would not have the same results as in the past, and Dr. Consiglio, is a brilliant surgeon, with the BEST bedside manner. He genuinely cares about his patients. If only every surgeon was like this! After the surgery, when he went out to tell my family that is was over, he was smiling from ear to ear, instantly letting them know, that all was well. Very happy, all the way around!

Refuses to give rabies shot to people who actually need them. Dr. Literally didn't know what rabies were. Dr. Wanted to delay rabies shot, despite the dangers. This hospital is heading towards a law suit.

I was brought to this awful place many years ago when I was about 14... and I am still scarred from my bad experience there. Most unprofessional, ignorant, and rude staff, except for the Australian MRI Doctor I encountered. It took several staff members to hold me down and perform a spinal tap on me against my will because they falsely assumed I had meningitis when I went in for a headache and vomiting. It turned out to be a bad case of PMS. This hospital is full of morons. I am not convinced that much has changed there in the last 15 years after reading some of these other 1 star reviews. Bottom line: If you love your self, go anywhere else but here. Where is Dr. House when you need him? This place gets an F for Failure.

This hospital is trying to save a buck by hiring undereducated/underexperienced ARNP etc in the ER BUT yet still bill you as if you've seen a true doctor. Went in with 1st and 2nd degree burns to my chest and arms, blistering and in excruciating pain and this "child" walks in for two seconds and proceeds to say go home, take a shower and out some cream on the blisters and areas the skin peeling off, I ask for something for the pain and get told "we're not allowed to provide pain relief" but heres the bill saying you saw a doctor. Can't wait for these unethical morons to get hurt and get a taste of their own or excuse me a lack of their own medicine.... My veterinarian has more compassion than these children working at Jackson ER...

Brought my family member here. It was a long wait from the start and she repeatedly told them she had a migraine and fever for the last 3 days and they just said, here's some Motrin and we need to test for all these different things. So it was basically just a guessing game. Bad attitudes from check in on down and no one seems to have any knowledge of what they're doing.

Outstanding hospital. I've been a patient in many hospitals over the years and have visited friends and family in hospitals in many States and I can say that the experience I've had with this hospital and its staff is awesome. I am very impressed. The doctors, nurses and staff are outstanding. I will recommend this hospital to everyone I know. A++++++++

Went there with my 8 year old son who woke up at midnight screaming in pain with his stomach. We sat there 2 hours, only to be told it more than likely we had another 3 hour wait said they were full in the back!
Needless to say we left to go to a hospital in Dothan!!!
This hospital isn't fit for a dog, let alone humans!!

I came here with 200/100 blood pressure &, 8 hours later, left with 200/100, largely because the nurse came in at 11pm & gave me a shot that kept me up all night.

If I were dying I‚Äôd drive to Dothan or Tallahassee before I went to this joke of a hospital. I‚Äôve had numerous terrible experiences, not only personal, but with multiple family members as well. Just do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt go here.

My husband went there last night April 28 2018 with severe pain and swollen knee he couldn't even walk he couldn't put any weight on his left leg he was diagnosed with osteoarthritis he was told to go home there wasn't any thing that they could do for him the pa said the hospital didn't draw fluid of the joints or give cortisone shots in the joints he wouldn't give him any cortisone pills to bring down the swelling or any pain pills for the pain except tramadol which did not help him he was told by the nurse if he wasn't better in three days to go see a doctor he went to the Er on a Saturday night to get some help instead all he got was no help and a lot more pain by the trip to get there it was a painful wasted trip for nothing we have learned the hard way if there is a next time we are going to dothan
